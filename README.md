# Scytale Frontend demo

Scytale Frontend website displays a nice dashboard to view your pull requests.

## Features

- Show your pull requests with customizing filtering.

## Instructions:

- "git clone" the repo.
- "npm start" in dir.
- open [scytale](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.
- have fun!.

## Side note:

- Because Im showing the labels as select html tag and not uses search bar for example the labels options are restarting every new request, this could be solved with a search bar to fix the problem where empty input showing all.
